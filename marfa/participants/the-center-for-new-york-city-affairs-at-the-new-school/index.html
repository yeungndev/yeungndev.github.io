					<div class="entry-content">
						<p>The Center for New York City Affairs seeks to improve the effectiveness of government and other organizations in their work with low-income urban communities in New York City. The Center works where people’s lives intersect with government and community organizations to illuminate the impact of public policy on the lives of ordinary people. We are committed to constant collaboration with government and non-profit organizations, residents, advocates, researchers and journalists. The Center is widely recognized for its role as a non-partisan broker of information and analysis.</p>
<p>The Center for New York City Affairs at The New School has a long, successful history of hosting engaging and timely public forums that include members of the community and spark meaningful discussion among practitioners, policymakers, intellectuals, and the public. Public events at the Center boost a diverse and robust audience, including community and cultural leaders, government officials, nonprofit and academic administrators, students and their parents, community members and members of the press.</p>
<p><strong>Program Description</strong></p>
<p><em>FOOD & CLIMATE CHANGE: GROWING A CULTURAL MOVEMENT</em></p>
<p>Thursday, October 24, 2013, 6pm-8pm</p>
<p>Theresa Lang Community and Student Center<br>
Arnhold Hall, 55 West 13th Street, 2nd floor<br>
New York, NY</p>
<p>Food has powerful cultural meaning, and has increasingly become part of the growing ideological and political discussions around the planet’s changing climate. Food can help communities develop, sustain, and increase their viability while helping mitigate negative impacts of climate change.</p>
<p>This cross-disciplinary brainstorming and dialogue will examine how sustainable, locally designed and developed solutions can help communities respond to the challenges of climate change. The discussion will focus on design and cultural interventions that reconnect people to food production while transforming the environment.</p>
<p>This forum aims to spur discussion and action among farmers, urban community leaders and innovators, designers, artists, policymakers, scholars and others who are engaged in developing effective and imaginative responses to climate change.</p>
<p>A conversation with</p>
<p><b>Linda Goode Bryant, </b>founding director, Project EATS</p>

<p><b>Radhika Subramaniam</b>, director + chief curator, Sheila C. Johnson Design Center, Parsons The New School for Design</p>
<p><b>Joel Towers</b>, executive dean, Parsons The New School for Design</p>
