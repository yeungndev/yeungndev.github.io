				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.artnews.com/" target="_blank">ARTnews</a> recently profiled our partner for <a href="http://ny.marfadialogues.org/" target="_blank">Marfa Dialogues/New York</a>,the Rauschenberg Foundation, discussing its various philanthropic endeavors, notable programs, and the organization&#8217;s relationship to the life and goals of its founder: the late painter and activist, Robert Rauschenberg.</p>
<p>An excerpt:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Marfa Dialogues/New York” is just one of an array of initiatives funded and supported by the Rauschenberg Foundation since it embarked on full-scale operations in 2012. Others include a visual literacy campaign in Tanzania, art workshops in inner-city laundromats, small-scale artist-run institutions across the United States, and an artist-residency program in Rauschenberg’s studio in the barrier islands of Florida. In the process, the foundation has established itself as a dynamic presence in the world of cultural philanthropy, maintaining Rauschenberg’s own impassioned commitment to charitable causes while extending his signature artistic ethos of bridging “the gap between art and life.”</p>
<p>“These aren’t just grants that we’re going to give to art institutions that do Rauschenberg exhibitions—that’s just not what we do,” said Christy MacLear, the foundation’s executive director. “We look at our grant making through the lens of the values that defined Bob. So you don’t only say, ‘What would Bob do?’ Instead, you set up a framework so that a hundred years from now you can ask: Is it collaborative? Is it boundary-breaking? Is it risk-taking? Is there a concept of creative problem-solving? Is it international and looking at art as a method of peacekeeping?”</p>
<p>“They’ve hit the ground running,” said Jack Flam, president and CEO of the Dedalus Foundation, which was founded by Robert Motherwell to foster public understanding of modern art while preserving the painter’s own artistic legacy. “In classic philanthropy, you give money away. Then there’s another kind, where you start programs that give money away. But then again there are artist foundations that are actually involved in programs as they develop, which in fact is something all artist foundations are thinking about now. They’re doing that from the start at the Rauschenberg Foundation.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://ny.marfadialogues.org/participants/staten-island-arts/" target="_blank">Marfa Dialogues/New York</a> alum, Tattfoo Tan, recently unveiled his newest project, Nature Matching System at Seymour Dual Language Academy in Syracuse, New York. As described by the artist: &#8220;The Nature Matching System is a color chart&#8230; used to remind us to consume our recommended daily dose of fruits and vegetables.&#8221;</p>
<p>The project, which is composed of a &#8220;curriculum&#8221; booklet and a mural, was a result of Tan&#8217;s collaboration with Professor Marion Wilson, who teaches a class about community engagement at Syracuse University. For Nature Matching System, Wilson&#8217;s students, inspired by Tan&#8217;s work, designed a curriculum and were then required to teach it to a 3rd grader at the local elementary school.</p>
<p>Tan hopes to spread his &#8220;colorful and healthy effort&#8221; to other schools by allowing the <a href="http://issuu.com/tattfoo/docs/nmscurriculum" target="_blank">booklet</a> to be downloaded for free.</p>
<p>To learn more about Tan and his practice, read his recent article <a href="http://creativetimereports.org/2014/03/31/tattfoo-tan-nutrition-isnt-pretty/" target="_blank">&#8220;Nutrition Isn&#8217;t Pretty&#8221;</a> for <a href="http://creativetimereports.org/" target="_blank">Creative Time Reports</a>. In &#8220;Nutrition&#8221;, Tan discusses the effects climate change has on our agriculture and asks us to &#8220;reduce food waste by rethinking what produce should look like.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>An excerpt from &#8220;Bridging the Gap,&#8221; by Alex Travers in <a href="https://questmag.com/"><i>Quest Magazine</i></a>&#8230;</b></p>
<p>“Gap Ecology (Three Still Lives with Cherry Pickers and Palms),” <a href="http://www.socratessculpturepark.org/">Socrates Sculpture Park</a>’s current installation by artist David Brooks, is composed of three 60-foot boom lifts filled with plants&#8230;.</p>
<p>The artist’s extraordinary gesture was inspired by the light gaps—exposed areas formed by falling trees that allow new species to grow—of the Amazon rainforest. At first glace, it may be difficult to relate “Gap Ecology” to this phenomenon. But the presence of Manhattan’s skyline looming in the background almost slows down time and points out things you’ve never seen before. With all this in place, it’s easier to begin to understand Brooks’ work: These lights gaps resemble the electric-light gaps of New York City—“from dormant construction sites, to the formation of urban parkland, or natural disasters such as Sandy,” he explains. In fact, Brooks relocates the installation to a different spot in the park each week. While this move may seem purely cinematic, he claims it highlights how important structural flexibly is to urban environments.</p>
<p>Brooks excels at showcasing the relationship between the individual and the built and natural environment.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>by David Brooks, an artist commissioned by Socrates Sculpture Park as part of Marfa Dialogues/NY</em></p>
<p>When considering a sculptural intervention to take place in NYC, that would act both as a symbolic gesture as well as a discursive device furthering a conversation around climate change, I naturally thought of the Amazon!</p>
<p>In the Amazonian forest, the onslaught of rainy season storms often results in the natural felling of old growth trees. When one of these towering hardwood giants topples, it can take a handful of neighboring trees with it, thus ripping a hole in the forest canopy and forming a “light gap.” This newly formed gap in the forest is quickly colonized by opportunistic species in the undergrowth &#8212; palms, bamboos and various shrubby plants that capitalize on such improvisational events. Taking advantage of their brief exposure to light, these pioneering species begin fruiting and flowering at accelerated speeds, attracting numerous bands of animal life to their momentary bursts of growth &#8212; a veritable bacchanalia. These species are not designed for long-term existence in the rainforest, but are designed to take advantage of a rupture in the status quo.</p>
<p>My installation at <a href="http://www.socratessculpturepark.org/">Socrates Sculpture Park</a> makes an analogy between this phenomenon common in rainforest ecology with that of New York City’s urban fabric. With this installation, <em><a href="http://www.socratessculpturepark.org/exhibitions/exhibition/gap-ecology">Gap Ecology (Three Still Lives with Cherry Pickers and Palms)</a></em>, one may recall the numerous &#8220;light gaps&#8221; that dot the city &#8212; from dormant construction sites, the formation of urban parkland, or natural devastations such as Sandy.</p>
<p>Here in New York City, the priorities within our daily lives indirectly dictate the shape of our infrastructures, which in turn dictate the shape of the landscape around us, which affects the health of the larger biosphere, which comes back around to affect our daily priorities. <em>Gap Ecology</em> is conceived as a symbolic gesture that bridges the perceptual gaps between these micro to macro spheres. It is a roving installation, meaning I relocate it to a different place in the park each week, and its constant movement signifies the ever-changing landscape and need for structural flexibility within our urban environment.</p>
<p><em>Gap Ecology</em> consists of three “cherry pickers”, or aerial boom lifts &#8212; common pieces of heavy machinery that tend to live on job sites throughout the duration of large construction projects. Paralleling the rainforest cycle, the passenger baskets of each boom lift are filled to the brim with palm trees &#8212; enacting their own bacchanalia above the park. Cherry pickers are not infrastructure per se, but they are the hands that touch infrastructure. Placed at Socrates, in an urban landscape that has undergone a visible infrastructural development, as well as a building dormancy, and adaptations that account for development’s affect on a neighborhood, <em>Gap Ecology</em> acts as a beacon to passersby of the ongoing change and evolution in their built and natural environment.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:<br />
New York, New York &#8211; September 23rd 2013 &#8211; <a href="http://www.marfadialogues.org/participants/imc-lab-gallery/" target="_blank">The IMC Lab + Gallery</a> is pleased to present “Climate Art: New Ways of Seeing Data”, a show on the perspectives of data, climate, and art curated by Isabel Walcott Draves, Founder of LISA (Leaders in Software and Art).</p>
<p>This data visualization exhibit is part of the Marfa Dialogues/NY, a citywide examination of climate change science, environmental activism and artistic practice happening this October and November in New York City. Marfa Dialogues/NY features more than 20 Program Partners, including the IMC Lab + Gallery, and a spectrum of exhibitions, performance, and interdisciplinary discussions at the intersection of the arts and climate change.</p>
<p><em>Can the things we once thought of as infinite be quantified? If they are not infinite, when will they end?</em></p>
<p>This collection of works brings together a selection of pieces by established software artists Ursula Endlicher, Ben Fry, Aaron Koblin, Nathalie Miebach, Camille Seaman, and Karolina Sobecka, which attempt to measure the immeasurable: the directed gaze, existence, the sky, power.</p>
<p>Looked at through the lens of climate change, these works make us think about our interaction with the natural world, and whether something that used to seem impassive, impenetrable, and immovable &#8212; the globe, the bedrock we stand on, this Earth &#8212; is in fact as fragile as a cloud.</p>
<p>If taking the measure of something means forming an opinion about it, the data driving these pieces make us think more carefully about the logistics of our environment. The exhibit invites the viewer to notice our ecosystem and consider our impact upon it as a real and quantifiable force.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;In an era of climate change and species extinction, it only makes sense that we try to document the minutiae of what remains. But it is just as logical to pause </em><em>from time to time to consider what cannot be calculated&#8221;.</em> Akiko Busch, Author, <em>The Incidental Steward: Reflections on Citizen Science</em></p>
<p>The exhibit opens October 12, 7-9 PM at the <a href="http://www.marfadialogues.org/participants/imc-lab-gallery/" target="_blank">IMC Lab + Gallery</a> and will remain on view through November 27.<br />
