				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elizabeth Barclay interviewed <a href="http://www.marfadialogues.org/participants/staten-island-arts/" target="_blank">Tattfoo Tan</a> about his MD/NY project, New Earth MRE for <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2013/11/18/245978167/how-to-prepare-for-climate-disasters-artist-says-dehydrate-food?sc=tw&amp;cc=share" target="_blank">NPR&#8217;s The Salt blog</a> &#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Tan, who was born in Malaysia and moved to New York in 2000, calls himself a &#8220;social sculpture artist&#8221; who collaborates with the public around ecology, food and urban agriculture issues. He has studied permaculture and composting, and since 2010, he has been raising egg-laying hens in his backyard.</p>
<p>As Tan started plotting how to design food for climate emergencies, he spotted a surplus in the food system: ugly vegetables too misshapen or mottled for farmers to sell. He rescued the vegetables from a local market, and began to dehydrate them in a dehydrator and experiment with recipes. Then he vacuum-sealed them so they would last for up to a year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dedrydrating food is actually an old technology, developed before we had refrigeration,&#8221; says Tan. &#8220;I&#8217;m using a contemporary version of it, because once again we might need it in case of emergency.&#8221;</p>
<p>His concoctions, which he callsÂ <a href="http://www.tattfoo.com/new_earth/NewEarthMRE.html">New Earth &#8211; Meals Ready to Eat</a>, include dehydrated bits of potato, coconut milk and oregano, which, with a little hot water, can be reconstituted into a flavorful version of mashed potatoes. Another is the apple sauce and prosciutto, with dried apple and ham. (He wasn&#8217;t offering samples when The Salt visited his studio.)</p></blockquote>
