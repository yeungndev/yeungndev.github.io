				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://ny.marfadialogues.org/participants/staten-island-arts/" target="_blank">Marfa Dialogues/New York</a> alum, Tattfoo Tan, recently unveiled his newest project, Nature Matching System at Seymour Dual Language Academy in Syracuse, New York. As described by the artist: &#8220;The Nature Matching System is a color chart&#8230; used to remind us to consume our recommended daily dose of fruits and vegetables.&#8221;</p>
<p>The project, which is composed of a &#8220;curriculum&#8221; booklet and a mural, was a result of Tan&#8217;s collaboration with Professor Marion Wilson, who teaches a class about community engagement at Syracuse University. For Nature Matching System, Wilson&#8217;s students, inspired by Tan&#8217;s work, designed a curriculum and were then required to teach it to a 3rd grader at the local elementary school.</p>
<p>Tan hopes to spread his &#8220;colorful and healthy effort&#8221; to other schools by allowing the <a href="http://issuu.com/tattfoo/docs/nmscurriculum" target="_blank">booklet</a> to be downloaded for free.</p>
<p>To learn more about Tan and his practice, read his recent article <a href="http://creativetimereports.org/2014/03/31/tattfoo-tan-nutrition-isnt-pretty/" target="_blank">&#8220;Nutrition Isn&#8217;t Pretty&#8221;</a> for <a href="http://creativetimereports.org/" target="_blank">Creative Time Reports</a>. In &#8220;Nutrition&#8221;, Tan discusses the effects climate change has on our agriculture and asks us to &#8220;reduce food waste by rethinking what produce should look like.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elizabeth Barclay interviewed <a href="http://www.marfadialogues.org/participants/staten-island-arts/" target="_blank">Tattfoo Tan</a> about his MD/NY project, New Earth MRE for <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2013/11/18/245978167/how-to-prepare-for-climate-disasters-artist-says-dehydrate-food?sc=tw&amp;cc=share" target="_blank">NPR&#8217;s The Salt blog</a> &#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Tan, who was born in Malaysia and moved to New York in 2000, calls himself a &#8220;social sculpture artist&#8221; who collaborates with the public around ecology, food and urban agriculture issues. He has studied permaculture and composting, and since 2010, he has been raising egg-laying hens in his backyard.</p>
<p>As Tan started plotting how to design food for climate emergencies, he spotted a surplus in the food system: ugly vegetables too misshapen or mottled for farmers to sell. He rescued the vegetables from a local market, and began to dehydrate them in a dehydrator and experiment with recipes. Then he vacuum-sealed them so they would last for up to a year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dedrydrating food is actually an old technology, developed before we had refrigeration,&#8221; says Tan. &#8220;I&#8217;m using a contemporary version of it, because once again we might need it in case of emergency.&#8221;</p>
<p>His concoctions, which he calls <a href="http://www.tattfoo.com/new_earth/NewEarthMRE.html">New Earth &#8211; Meals Ready to Eat</a>, include dehydrated bits of potato, coconut milk and oregano, which, with a little hot water, can be reconstituted into a flavorful version of mashed potatoes. Another is the apple sauce and prosciutto, with dried apple and ham. (He wasn&#8217;t offering samples when The Salt visited his studio.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Last week&#8217;s conversation between Maya Lin and NRDC President Frances Beinecke, now archived online. From the <a href="http://www.nrdc.org/marfa-dialogues/" target="_blank">NRDC website</a> &#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>On Monday, November 4th, two of the leading voices on the issue of climate change &#8212; artist and honorary NRDC Trustee Maya Lin and NRDC President Frances Beinecke &#8212; discussed the critical role artists, advocates and scientists play in addressing climate change, the role of art in mobilizing and educating the public, and the great potential for environmentally focused artwork to affect climate change policy. The interactive discussion, part of the Marfa Dialogues / New York series, used Maya Lin&#8217;s most recent project, What is Missing?, as an example of collaborations to engage the public about climate change. Anne Pasternak, President and Artistic Director of Creative Time, moderated the discussion.</p></blockquote>

An excerpt &#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>A longtime advocate of environmental awareness, Miss was eager to participate in the Marfa Dialogues, she said in phone conversation with<em> A.i.A.</em>: &#8220;Anything is better when there&#8217;s a group of voices rather than just a single voice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fairfax Dorn, of Texas contemporary art center Ballroom Marfa, founded Marfa Dialogues in 2010, hosting programming that explored issues related to the U.S.-Mexico border. A second edition on climate change followed in 2012. This year, the organizers hope to expand the program&#8217;s reach by extending its length to two months and by holding it in New York. Previous Marfa Dialogues have been held in the small Texas town (pop. 2,000) that gives the event its name.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><strong>Marfa Dialogues/NY: Walking and Bicycle Tours</strong> (Saturday and Sunday) Several free events, pairing artists and scientists, will focus on how those in the art world can address problems associated with climate change. The programming is being offered by the Marfa Dialogues/NY, a collaboration of the Robert Rauschenberg Foundation; Ballroom Marfa, a Texas-based cultural center; the Public Concern Foundation, a nonprofit; and others. The promotion of bicycles as a mode of transportation in the Bronx is the focus of a bicycle ride down Broadway on Saturday, beginning at 10 a.m. at the East 180th Street stop on the No. 2 and 5 trains. Those who wish to participate need to provide their own equipment. On Sunday, several walking tours along Broadway will focus on different ecological issues in the city. At noon, the subject is the impact of trash and disposables, and a group will meet at Madison Square Park, at 23rd Street; at 1:45 p.m., a those looking at how the city handles storm runoff will meet at 173rd Street; and at 2:45 p.m., a group will meet at 168th Street effects of the environment on health.

<p><strong>HIGHWAY POSTERS</strong></p>
<p>E.A.T. board member Theodore Kheel had long been an advocate for public transportation, and as early as 1965 was <a href="http://secondavenuesagas.com/2007/02/13/kheel-subways-should-be-cheap-as-free/" target="_blank">proposing</a> that subways be <a href="http://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/42102/" target="_blank">free</a> in New York City. One of his affinities with Rauschenberg  and Klüver was their shared belief in the power of art to communicate new societal ideas and the importance of artists speaking out on issues. He began a decades-long collaboration with E.A.T. and Rauschenberg to provide ways for the artist to “speak out” on local and global environmental issues.</p>
<p>In 1970 Rauschenberg had created his first poster dealing with the environment. Inspired perhaps by the Vietnam War protestor teach-ins, Senator Gaylord Nelson from Wisconsin called for an environmental teach-in, which he called Earth Day, to be held on April 22, 1970. The response was huge, over 20 million people participated that year, and Earth Day is now an annual event celebrated by more than  500 million people and 175 national governments. Rauschenberg created the first <i>Earth Day</i><b> </b>poster, published in an edition of 300 signed and 10,000 unsigned copies to support the American Environment Foundation.</p>

<p>Two years later, Kheel asked E.A.T. to coordinate a project in which Rauschenberg and seven more artists, including Jared Bark, Romare Bearden,  Christo, Tom Gormley, Alan Sonfist, and  Margery Strider, were asked to create prints commenting on the importance of public transportation versus the use of private cars and the unfettered growth of highways.</p>
<p>The works were printed in the magazine <em>LithOpinion</em>,  published by the Local One Amalgamated Lithographers of America union, to accompany articles by Kheel, Senator Edward Kennedy and writer Ben Kelley in a section called &#8220;Our National Transportation Mess.” Ben Kelly detailed the hold the &#8220;Highway Lobby&#8221; had on spending in the 1956 Federal Highway Trust Fund, which used some portion of the tax on gasoline to build highways throughout the country. Seen as necessary in the 1950s, by 1972 the program was so “successful” that, as Kheel noted in a 1992 &#8220;pledge for the environment&#8221; talk at the UN, “in less than two decades we had built enough highways to travel from here to the moon.” But along the way this highway system decimated the use of railroads, led to growth of suburbs that emptied cities of their middle classes,  not to mention, “ traffic congestion, air pollution, ozone layer depletion, and the rapid deterioration of  mass transit.”  Senator Edward Kennedy outlined his attempt to pass legislation that use portions of the Highway Trust fund to fund mass transit initiatives, and Kheel wrote of his fight to have the Port Authority use funds for an effective transportation system in the New York City area.</p>

<p>Rauschenberg’s work  featured the words of William Burroughs and is discussed in an excellent article, “Rauschenberg’s Environmental Activism,”  by Robert Mattison in a book published on the occasion of an exhibition focusing on Rauschenberg’s works dealing with a variety of environmental subjects at the Jacobson Howard Gallery that opened a month before  his death. Of <em>Burrough’s Dream</em>, Mattison writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>The artist had recently visited Beat writer William Burroughs and discussed the project with him. Burroughs told Rauschenberg of a dream in which the words “they did not fully understand the technique / in a very short time they nearly wrecked the planet” had appeared to him. For Rauschenberg, Burroughs’ dream captured the difference between good intentions and knowledgeable execution. … While Rauschenberg’s collage method is highlighted by the hand-torn fragments, they were all very carefully chosen. In addition, each letter of Burroughs’ phrase, featuring a different color and  visual pattern, was laboriously hand-cut and attached to the original work. The final piece is handmade using a great deal of care and technique. By analogy, the sure technique of  <em>Burroughs’ Dream</em><b> </b>embodies the notion that expertise will be required to solve our environmental dilemma. (Robert Mattison, Rauschenberg’s Environmental Activism,” <em>Your Turn Last Turn:  Robert Rauschenberg and the Environmental Crisis</em>, New York: Jacobson Howard Gallery, 2008, p. 11-12.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Coincidentally this work was made in 1972, the year of the UN Conference on the Human Environment  in Stockholm June  1972, which was the first international gathering that paid attention  to  the global human impact on the environment, and attempted to forge a common approach to address the challenge of preserving and enhancing the human environment.</p>
<p>Twenty years later in 1992 when plans were being made for the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro &#8212; now known as the <a href="http://www.un.org/geninfo/bp/enviro.html" target="_blank">Earth Summit</a> &#8212; the Secretary General of  the conference Maurice Strong, who had headed the <a href="http://legal.un.org/avl/ha/dunche/dunche.html" target="_blank">1972  UN conference in Stockholm</a>, turned to Ted Kheel to gain support and publicize its message in the general population. Kheel drafted what was called the Earth Pledge:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I pledge to make the earth a secure and hospitable home for  present and future generations.”</p></blockquote>
<p>He set about getting signatures for this Earth Pledge as a sign of support for the Earth Summit, with the idea that “the Pledge can give everyone in the  world a chance to participate in the Conference, an opportunity to emphasize their concern about its success … the Pledge underscores that everyone is part of the problem and indispensable to the solution … it affirms the  universality of the challenges we face&#8230; It also asks each one of us to do what we can in our daily lives to help, and there is much we can do.</p>
<p>Then as Kheel himself tells</p>
<blockquote><p>Bob Rauschenberg’s comment on the Highway Trust Fund was right on target. It assessed neither blame nor praise … his comment is equally applicable to most environmental challenges… When I was asked to promote the Pledge I turned once mere to Bob for help … and he has created a remarkable work of art commemorating the conference and promoting the Pledge.”</p></blockquote>
<p>These statements were made at a ceremony at the UN to launch the Earth Pledge effort and introduce Rauschenberg’s work:</p>

<p>Rauschenberg had created a painting, <em>Last Turn Your Turn</em>, which incorporated the words of the pledge and again expressed up each individual’s responsibility for the future of the environment. The Robert Rauschenberg Foundation donated a limited edition of prints of the image to support the effort of the Earth Summit Pledge Committee.</p>

<p>Kheel also enlisted the support of Transportation Displays Incorporated (TDI),  one of the largest outdoor advertising companies n the country, who donated space on the exterior and interior of busses in 30 cities across the United States January to March 1992. Rauschenberg created the work <em>Ozone</em> to be placed in those public spaces</p>

</a><span style="font-size: small;">Rauschenberg at the Rio Earth Summit in Rio in June  1992 with Ashli Varma and Bernard Kalb. Varma was the editor of the </span><i>style=&#8221;font-size: small;&#8221;&gt;Earth Summit Times,</i><span style="font-size: small;"> a newspaper published by Kheel for the Earth Summit. </span><span style="font-size: small;">(Photo: </span><a style="font-size: small;" href="http://ashalivarma.com/index.html" target="_blank">Ashli Varma</a><span style="font-size: small;">)</span></p>
<p>While the results were not as far reaching as world environmentalists would wanted, the delegates of 178 nations in attendance at the Earth Summit unanimously endorsed Agenda 21, an historic document based on the concept of sustainable development, defined as &#8220;development meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.&#8221;</p>
<p>A UN Summary of the legal implications of the Rio Earth Summit found that</p>
<blockquote><p>… the Rio Declaration, which reaffirms and builds upon the Stockholm Declaration, has nevertheless proved to be a major environmental legal landmark.</p></blockquote>
<p>In resolution 47/190 of 22 December 1992 the General Assembly endorsed the Rio Declaration and urged that necessary action be taken to provide effective follow-up. Since then, the <a href="http://www.unep.org/Documents.Multilingual/Default.asp?documentid=97&amp;articleid=1503" target="_blank">Declaration</a>, whose application at national, regional and international levels has been the subject of a specific, detailed review at the General Assembly’s special session on Rio+5 in 1997, has served as a basic normative framework at subsequent global environmental gatherings, namely the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in 2002 and “Rio+20”, the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in 2012.</p>
<p>This brings us to  2012 the year of the most recent Earth Summit, 2012, which paid tribute to the original Rio Summit by calling itself Rio+20. It was held the same year that planning started for Marfa Dialogues/New York and the meeting in the Chapel, where the ideas and words of Rauschenberg still inspire the effort:  “I try to use my art to communicate that you, yourself, must take responsibility for life on earth.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>An excerpt from &#8220;Bridging the Gap,&#8221; by Alex Travers in <a href="https://questmag.com/"><i>Quest Magazine</i></a>&#8230;</b></p>
<p>“Gap Ecology (Three Still Lives with Cherry Pickers and Palms),” <a href="http://www.socratessculpturepark.org/">Socrates Sculpture Park</a>’s current installation by artist David Brooks, is composed of three 60-foot boom lifts filled with plants&#8230;.</p>
<p>The artist’s extraordinary gesture was inspired by the light gaps—exposed areas formed by falling trees that allow new species to grow—of the Amazon rainforest. At first glace, it may be difficult to relate “Gap Ecology” to this phenomenon. But the presence of Manhattan’s skyline looming in the background almost slows down time and points out things you’ve never seen before. With all this in place, it’s easier to begin to understand Brooks’ work: These lights gaps resemble the electric-light gaps of New York City—“from dormant construction sites, to the formation of urban parkland, or natural disasters such as Sandy,” he explains. In fact, Brooks relocates the installation to a different spot in the park each week. While this move may seem purely cinematic, he claims it highlights how important structural flexibly is to urban environments.</p>
<p>Brooks excels at showcasing the relationship between the individual and the built and natural environment.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From &#8220;Can Marfa Bring Its Magic to Manhattan?&#8221; in <a href="http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/15/happenings-can-marfa-bring-its-magic-to-manhattan/?_r=0" target="_blank"><em>T Magazine</em></a> &#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>You don’t have to be a scientist, engineer or policy maker to weigh in on the impact of climate change. Right now, all around New York City, visual artists, architects and performers are tackling the subject as part of Marfa Dialogues/New York, a two-month series of environmentally engaged public events.</p>
<p>The ambitious festival is organized by Ballroom Marfa, a tiny gallery in the tiny West Texas hamlet of Marfa (population 1,899, according to last year’s census). But the desert town’s cultural footprint has long belied its size. In 1971, the Minimalist artist Donald Judd arrived there from Manhattan, and subsequently transformed a decommissioned Army base into the Chinati Foundation, an indoor/outdoor museum that is a favorite pilgrimage of the art cognoscenti. More recently, a wave of artists has moved there. “There Will Be Blood” and “No Country for Old Men” were both filmed there, and in 2008, the town got its own film festival. Founded in 2003 in a former dance hall, Ballroom Marfa serves as a younger counterpart to the Judd compound. Its year-round programming balances the emerging with the established (Takashi Murakami balloons, screenings with John Waters, a Bon Iver concert), helping place Marfa within the broader cultural consciousness. This year’s New York migration offers proof of Ballroom’s expanding sphere of influence.</p></blockquote>
