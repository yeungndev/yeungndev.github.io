2:00 PM</p>
<p>THE JEROME L. GREENE PERFORMANCE SPACE<br />

<p>The forecast is extreme: The 2000s were the warmest decade in our recorded history. In 2010, a Christmas blizzard buried our streets beneath more than 20 inches of snow. One year ago, Hurricane Sandy devastated our city with wind and rain.</p>
<p>WNYC, in collaboration with <a href="http://www.marfadialogues.org/" target="_blank">Marfa Dialogues/New York</a>, will bring four of our country&#8217;s top experts on environmental science and policy for an historic panel discussion on the urgent and confounding questions raised by accelerating climate change.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Lehrer</strong>, host of WNYC&#8217;s eponymous Peabody Award-winning morning show, welcomes physicist and visionary environmental scientist <strong>Amory Lovins</strong>; Chief of Energy Finance and Planning for New York State <strong>Richard Kauffman</strong>; <strong>Margot Anderson</strong>, Executive Director of the Energy Project for the BiPartisan Policy Center and a long-time US senior energy policy maker; and <strong>Guy Nordenson</strong>, the Princeton structural engineer and professor of architecture appointed by Mayor Bloomberg to the New York City Panel on Climate Change.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ll explore the politics of climate change and explain the latest strategies to limit environmental damage, as well as the promising initiatives already underway nationally and here in the tri-state region.</p>
