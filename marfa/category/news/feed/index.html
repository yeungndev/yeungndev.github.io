				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.artnews.com/" target="_blank">ARTnews</a> recently profiled our partner for <a href="http://ny.marfadialogues.org/" target="_blank">Marfa Dialogues/New York</a>,the Rauschenberg Foundation, discussing its various philanthropic endeavors, notable programs, and the organization&#8217;s relationship to the life and goals of its founder: the late painter and activist, Robert Rauschenberg.</p>
<p>An excerpt:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Marfa Dialogues/New York” is just one of an array of initiatives funded and supported by the Rauschenberg Foundation since it embarked on full-scale operations in 2012. Others include a visual literacy campaign in Tanzania, art workshops in inner-city laundromats, small-scale artist-run institutions across the United States, and an artist-residency program in Rauschenberg’s studio in the barrier islands of Florida. In the process, the foundation has established itself as a dynamic presence in the world of cultural philanthropy, maintaining Rauschenberg’s own impassioned commitment to charitable causes while extending his signature artistic ethos of bridging “the gap between art and life.”</p>
<p>“These aren’t just grants that we’re going to give to art institutions that do Rauschenberg exhibitions—that’s just not what we do,” said Christy MacLear, the foundation’s executive director. “We look at our grant making through the lens of the values that defined Bob. So you don’t only say, ‘What would Bob do?’ Instead, you set up a framework so that a hundred years from now you can ask: Is it collaborative? Is it boundary-breaking? Is it risk-taking? Is there a concept of creative problem-solving? Is it international and looking at art as a method of peacekeeping?”</p>
<p>“They’ve hit the ground running,” said Jack Flam, president and CEO of the Dedalus Foundation, which was founded by Robert Motherwell to foster public understanding of modern art while preserving the painter’s own artistic legacy. “In classic philanthropy, you give money away. Then there’s another kind, where you start programs that give money away. But then again there are artist foundations that are actually involved in programs as they develop, which in fact is something all artist foundations are thinking about now. They’re doing that from the start at the Rauschenberg Foundation.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://ny.marfadialogues.org/participants/staten-island-arts/" target="_blank">Marfa Dialogues/New York</a> alum, Tattfoo Tan, recently unveiled his newest project, Nature Matching System at Seymour Dual Language Academy in Syracuse, New York. As described by the artist: &#8220;The Nature Matching System is a color chart&#8230; used to remind us to consume our recommended daily dose of fruits and vegetables.&#8221;</p>
<p>The project, which is composed of a &#8220;curriculum&#8221; booklet and a mural, was a result of Tan&#8217;s collaboration with Professor Marion Wilson, who teaches a class about community engagement at Syracuse University. For Nature Matching System, Wilson&#8217;s students, inspired by Tan&#8217;s work, designed a curriculum and were then required to teach it to a 3rd grader at the local elementary school.</p>
<p>Tan hopes to spread his &#8220;colorful and healthy effort&#8221; to other schools by allowing the <a href="http://issuu.com/tattfoo/docs/nmscurriculum" target="_blank">booklet</a> to be downloaded for free.</p>
<p>To learn more about Tan and his practice, read his recent article <a href="http://creativetimereports.org/2014/03/31/tattfoo-tan-nutrition-isnt-pretty/" target="_blank">&#8220;Nutrition Isn&#8217;t Pretty&#8221;</a> for <a href="http://creativetimereports.org/" target="_blank">Creative Time Reports</a>. In &#8220;Nutrition&#8221;, Tan discusses the effects climate change has on our agriculture and asks us to &#8220;reduce food waste by rethinking what produce should look like.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fortunately, if you missed Nora York&#8217;s performance of <em>Water Water Everywhere</em> last November at MDNY program partner, <a href="http://www.joespub.com/" target="_blank">Joe&#8217;s Pub at the Public Theater</a>, you have another chance to see this collaborative and <a href="http://www.marfadialogues.org/participants/joes-pub-at-the-public-theater-presents-nora-york/" target="_blank">&#8220;provocative new work.&#8221;</a> </p>
<p>As described by BRIC:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">In their new multi-media song cycle, singer and conceptual artist Nora York and co-composer Jamie Lawrence investigate the poetic and scientific weight of water — oceans, rivers, aquifers, lakes, streams, wells, and our bodies. Inspired by Handel’s Baroque orchestral Water Music Suites, Water Water Everywhere is both a love letter and a wake-up call about what is at stake in our current climate chaos.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">During their time at BRIC, York and Lawrence will collaborate with visual artist and cinematographer Carmen Osterlye on the visual elements of the performance.</p>
<p>For additional information, visit <a href="http://bricartsmedia.org/events/briclab-nora-york-and-jamie-lawrence-water-water-everywhere" target="_blank">BRIC</a> and be sure to read the description of <em>Water Water</em> on the Public Theater&#8217;s MDNY participant <a href="http://www.marfadialogues.org/participants/joes-pub-at-the-public-theater-presents-nora-york/" target="_blank">page</a>. </p>
<p><em>The work-in-progress showing of the piece will be on February 28, at 7pm at the BRIC House Artist Studio in Brooklyn, NY. </em></p>

In it, they &#8220;argue that natural gas is not a &#8216;bridge fuel&#8217; to less hazardous energy sources, but a grave danger to communal resources and the global climate.&#8221;</p>
<p>An excerpt:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The gas and oil industry would like to craft a wholesome image of natural gas as a clean resource and a “nonfossil” fuel. Neither of these characterizations is accurate. Yes, gas does burn with a nice blue flame at the end user’s stove. However, getting that gas to the stove is seriously contaminating our air and water. This is because pumping it in means using high-volume, slick-water hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. Unbeknownst to many, the process has profound health and environmental impacts. Thanks to aged and faulty infrastructure, often built on the cheap and left unchecked for years, gas inevitably leaks on the way from wells to pipelines. Add up all the dangers along the way, and one will soon find that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/29/opinion/gangplank-to-a-warm-future.html?partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=3&amp;" target="_blank">gas has a larger global climate impact than oil or coal</a>.</p>
<p>Later in the article, the authors discuss how even a place like New York City is affected by the fracking that happens miles away:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">When we mention fracking to people in New York City, they often ask if we’re concerned about a place upstate, as though we are protected because it happens so far away. Nothing could be further from the truth. The numerous risks associated with fracking for New York City residents include contamination of drinking water from the Delaware Catskill Watershed and exposure to radon, a radioactive gas known to cause lung cancer, from gas used for cooking. Since November 1, 2013, the Spectra pipeline, built by the Texas-based company Spectra Energy, has started pumping a mix of Marcellus shale natural gas that has <a href="http://www.damascuscitizensforsustainability.org/?s=radon+for+dinner" target="_blank">the highest levels of radon</a> in the United States from Manhattan’s West Village to the East 14th Street Con Edison plant, and to New Yorkers’ homes.</p>
<p>The Spectra pipeline is not the only recent danger New Yorkers face from the gas industry. <a href="http://www.citylimits.org/news/articles/5008/deadline-nears-for-public-input-on-rockaways-pipeline#.UugoI3fnbLZ" target="_blank">The Rockaway Lateral pipeline</a>, if approved, will run from underneath Brooklyn across Jamaica Bay and Rockaway Beach, threatening the ecosystem of Rockaway Bay. As we continue to develop natural gas, there will be more air pollution, contamination and <a href="http://www.damascuscitizensforsustainability.org/?s=food+contamination+" target="_blank">impacts on food and the foodshed</a>. With more drilling, there will be more waste and cuttings from drill sites, which trucks will be transporting to Long Island waste plants, likely resulting in spills and the contamination of Long Island Sound and the ocean beaches. Greater dependence on <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/Energy-Voices/2014/0112/Fracking-for-an-energy-renaissance-that-will-not-come" target="_blank">increasingly limited supplies of natural gas</a> will also lead to much higher prices. The high levels of methane emissions unleashed by projects like the Spectra and Rockaway pipelines will contribute to accelerating climate change and attendant dangers like rising seas. In Manhattan we are <a href="http://cooper.edu/events-and-exhibitions/exhibitions/emissions-images-mixing-layer" target="_blank">standing in a cloud of methane</a> from a leaky infrastructure, and the water around us is swelling.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How do climate change and environmental issues relate to art? High Line Art set out to answer this question, investigating the intersection between art and the environment. High Line Art is the curated program of Friends of the High Line, which manages and oversees the High Line park. To explore artistic production and the environment, High Line Art curated a film series titled Solar that includes a selection of four videos by four individual artists: Rosa Barba, Camille Henrot, Basim Magdy and Neïl Beloufa. The videos featured in Solar, on view now at High Line Channel 14, spotlight the effect of humans on the environment through both realistic and futuristic narratives. With this film series, High Line Art emphasizes the importance of environmental activism in the arts.</p>
<p>Over the past four weeks, we facilitated weekly “panels” between the curator, Cecilia Alemani, and the four artists in Solar. Using the hashtag #SolarPanel, these interviews occurred over Twitter every week in four installments, highlighting one artist per week. These tweets were only fragments of the full interviews, which we posted on our Tumblr the following day accompanied by an artist profile and a summary of the artist’s video. Through this program, the public gained an opportunity to learn more about the four artists whose films are featured on a more interactive platform. The artists’ fascinating answers offer a unique perspective into the artistic inspiration, process, and themes manifest in their work.</p>
<p>To read the full interviews and artist profiles, follow the links below to the High Line Art Tumblr feature on each artist:<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elizabeth Barclay interviewed <a href="http://www.marfadialogues.org/participants/staten-island-arts/" target="_blank">Tattfoo Tan</a> about his MD/NY project, New Earth MRE for <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2013/11/18/245978167/how-to-prepare-for-climate-disasters-artist-says-dehydrate-food?sc=tw&amp;cc=share" target="_blank">NPR&#8217;s The Salt blog</a> &#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Tan, who was born in Malaysia and moved to New York in 2000, calls himself a &#8220;social sculpture artist&#8221; who collaborates with the public around ecology, food and urban agriculture issues. He has studied permaculture and composting, and since 2010, he has been raising egg-laying hens in his backyard.</p>
<p>As Tan started plotting how to design food for climate emergencies, he spotted a surplus in the food system: ugly vegetables too misshapen or mottled for farmers to sell. He rescued the vegetables from a local market, and began to dehydrate them in a dehydrator and experiment with recipes. Then he vacuum-sealed them so they would last for up to a year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dedrydrating food is actually an old technology, developed before we had refrigeration,&#8221; says Tan. &#8220;I&#8217;m using a contemporary version of it, because once again we might need it in case of emergency.&#8221;</p>
<p>His concoctions, which he calls <a href="http://www.tattfoo.com/new_earth/NewEarthMRE.html">New Earth &#8211; Meals Ready to Eat</a>, include dehydrated bits of potato, coconut milk and oregano, which, with a little hot water, can be reconstituted into a flavorful version of mashed potatoes. Another is the apple sauce and prosciutto, with dried apple and ham. (He wasn&#8217;t offering samples when The Salt visited his studio.)</p></blockquote>
